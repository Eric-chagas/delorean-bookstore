# Delorean Bookstore Inc.
> "The future's past latest bookstore in town." - Someone, sometime. (probably 1985)

The Delorean Bookstore app is exactly what it's name implies, and also a cozy place to fellow Back to the future nerds out there.

The bookstore app is fully developed in kotlin, with springboot framework and aims to have a scalable microsservice architecture, which can be accessed 
through the **docs** (<- this will be a link someday). 

## The delorean-bookstore repo
This repo contains the apps main microsservice, and is fully maintained as a personal project by @Eric-chagas (eric_chagaso@protonmail.com).
Feel free to clone it, fork it, or do whatever else suits you best. If you want to get technical, head over to the **docs** and snoop around to 
learn a bit more. 

This project is powered by a time-traveling delorean, remember, AI can't hurt you in 1955 ;)
