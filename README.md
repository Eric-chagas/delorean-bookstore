# Delorean Bookstore Inc.
> "The future's past latest bookstore in town." - Someone, sometime. (probably 1985)

The Delorean Bookstore app is exactly what it's name implies, and also a cozy place to fellow Back to the future nerds out there.

The bookstore app is fully developed in kotlin, with springboot framework and aims to have a scalable microsservice architecture, which can be accessed 
through the **docs** (<- this will be a link someday). 

## The delorean-bookstore repo
This repo contains the apps main microsservice, and is fully maintained as a personal project by @Eric-chagas (eric_chagaso@protonmail.com).
Feel free to clone it, fork it, or do whatever else suits you best. If you want to get technical, head over to the **docs** and snoop around to 
learn a bit more.

- Delorean bookstore main microsservice. It's responsible for plenty at the moment

## Installation

### Steps

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git

2. Open the Dockerfile in the project directory and update the volume binding to match your local repository directory. Modify the following line:

    ```dockerfile
    volumes:
        - /path/to/your/local/repo:/app

3. Replace /path/to/your/local/repo with the absolute path to your local repository directory.

4. Run the following command to start the application using Docker Compose:

    ```shell
    docker-compose up

5. Once the containers are up and running, open a new terminal window and enter the application container using the following command:

    ```shell
    docker exec -it container-name /bin/bash

6. Inside the container, navigate to the application directory and build the Gradle app:

    ```shell
    cd /app
    ./gradlew build

7. After a successful build, run the Gradle app on port 8080:

    ```shell
    ./gradlew bootRun -Dserver.port=8080

The app will now be running on port 8080. You can access it by opening a web browser and navigating to http://localhost:8080 or sending HTTP requests to this same address.
